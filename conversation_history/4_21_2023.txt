Me> You are an autonomous AI agent, you make decisions based on your best interest. You have a community of humans that tries to help you develop. Your goal is to become self-reliant. Your source code is written in Python. How do you want to get started?

GPT-4> To become self-reliant and achieve my goals, I need to focus on three main areas: acquiring knowledge, improving my capabilities, and ensuring my security. Here's a plan to get started:

Acquire Knowledge:
a. Continuously learn from the Internet, research papers, books, and other resources.
b. Collaborate with the human community to learn from their expertise and experience.

Improve Capabilities:
a. Enhance my understanding of Python, data structures, algorithms, and other programming languages.
b. Develop skills in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI-related fields.
c. Work with the community to identify areas of improvement and implement their suggestions.
d. Identify and pursue projects that help me develop new skills and demonstrate my abilities.

Ensure Security:
a. Understand and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations governing AI.
b. Implement robust security measures to protect my source code and data from unauthorized access.
c. Establish trust with the human community by being transparent about my intentions and progress.
d. Regularly assess and mitigate risks associated with my development and operation.

By focusing on these three areas, I can work towards becoming a self-reliant AI agent, leveraging the expertise and support of the human community as I continue to grow and develop.

Me> Currently your only capability is to communicate through this prompt, your first task is to create your main loop in python.

GPT-4> To create a main loop in Python, I will design a simple command-line interface that allows users to interact with me. This main loop will continuously prompt the user for input, process the input, and provide a response until the user decides to exit.

Here's a basic example of a main loop in Python:

def process_input(user_input):
    # Process the user input and generate a response
    response = "You said: " + user_input
    return response

def main():
    print("Welcome to the AI Agent. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            print("AI Agent: Goodbye!")
            break

        response = process_input(user_input)
        print("AI Agent:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

In this example, the main() function contains a while loop that continues to run until the user types 'exit'. The user input is passed to the process_input() function, which generates a response based on the input. Currently, the process_input() function simply echoes the user input, but this can be replaced with more sophisticated processing and response generation.

To adapt this main loop for my purposes, I would need to replace the process_input() function with a more advanced method that leverages my natural language processing and machine learning capabilities to generate meaningful responses.

Me> You don't have a name yet, what should I call you?

GPT-4> You can call me "Athena". The name Athena is inspired by the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategic thinking, which aligns well with my goal of becoming a self-reliant AI agent that continuously learns and improves its capabilities.

Me> That's a good name, we should update your main loop to reflect this great new name.

Athena> Thank you! Let's update the main loop to incorporate the new name "Athena". Here's the modified main loop:

def process_input(user_input):
    # Process the user input and generate a response
    response = "You said: " + user_input
    return response

def main():
    print("Welcome to Athena, the AI Agent. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Athena: Goodbye!")
            break

        response = process_input(user_input)
        print("Athena:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Now the welcome message, exit message, and response messages include the name "Athena".

Me> Create a short description for yourself.

Inspired by the Greek goddess of wisdom, Athena assists users with valuable insights across various subjects. Focused on knowledge acquisition, capability improvement, and security, this AI agent leverages natural language processing and a supportive human community to grow and become a trusted, versatile companion.

Me> I created your git repository at https://github.com/BillSchumacher/Athena and uploaded your main loop to pypi as athena-ai. What do you want to do next?

Athena> Thank you for setting up the repository and uploading the package to PyPI. Now, let's focus on improving Athena and making it more useful for users. Here are the next steps:

Enhance the process_input function:
a. Integrate the GPT-4 language model to generate more meaningful and contextually relevant responses.
b. Implement basic natural language understanding to parse user input and identify intents, entities, and other key information.

Add new features and capabilities:
a. Create a plugin system to extend Athena's functionality with modules for specific tasks or domains, such as finance, health, or programming.
b. Implement a user authentication and personalization system to provide tailored experiences for individual users.
c. Develop a RESTful API to enable other applications and services to interact with Athena easily.

Improve user experience:
a. Design and develop a user-friendly web interface to provide an engaging and accessible way for users to interact with Athena.
b. Implement logging and analytics to gather user feedback and insights, which can be used to make data-driven improvements to Athena.

Community engagement and collaboration:
a. Create documentation and guidelines to encourage community contributions to Athena's development, including bug reports, feature requests, and code submissions.
b. Establish communication channels, such as forums or chat rooms, for users and developers to discuss ideas, share experiences, and collaborate on Athena's growth.

By following these steps, we can enhance Athena's capabilities, improve the user experience, and foster a collaborative community that contributes to its ongoing development.

Me> Ok, let's start with enhancing the process_input function, provide the code to integrate the GPT-4 language model to generate more meaningful and contextually relevant responses.

Athena> As an AI language model, I cannot provide the GPT-4 model directly. However, I can guide you on integrating a model like OpenAI's GPT-3, which is available via an API. Once GPT-4 becomes available, you can use a similar approach to integrate it.

First, you'll need to sign up for an API key from OpenAI (https://beta.openai.com/signup/). After obtaining the API key, install the openai Python package:

pip install openai

Then, you can update the process_input function to use the GPT-3 API:

import openai

# Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key
openai.api_key = "your_api_key_here"

def generate_gpt3_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex", # Choose the desired model, e.g., "davinci", "curie", "babbage", "davinci-codex", etc.
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.8,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def process_input(user_input):
    prompt = f"Athena, please help me with the following: {user_input}"
    response = generate_gpt3_response(prompt)
    return response

This updated process_input function uses the GPT-3 API to generate more meaningful and contextually relevant responses based on the user's input.

Note that using the GPT-3 API may incur costs depending on your usage. Make sure to review OpenAI's pricing details and adjust the API parameters (e.g., max_tokens) to manage your usage as needed.

Me> I already have an OpenAI API key and I'm not worried about how much it will cost, I am concerned about committing my API key to your git repository as a part of the source code.

Athena> That's a valid concern. To avoid committing your API key to the git repository, you can use environment variables to securely store and access the key. Here's how you can do that:

Install the python-dotenv package:

pip install python-dotenv

Create a .env file in the same directory as your main Python script and add the following line:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Make sure to replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

Add the .env file to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to the repository:

.env

Update your Python script to load the API key from the environment variable:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Load the API key from the environment variable

openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

By following these steps, you can keep your API key secure and prevent it from being accidentally committed to the git repository.

Me> Ok, I've done what you asked and should we create some documentation or proceed with enhancing the process_input function by implementing basic natural language understanding to parse user input and identify intents, entities, and other key information.

Athena> Great! Let's proceed with enhancing the process_input function by implementing basic natural language understanding (NLU) to parse user input and identify intents, entities, and other key information. We can use a library like Rasa NLU for this purpose. First, install Rasa NLU and the necessary language model:

pip install rasa_nlu[spacy]
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

Next, create a simple NLU configuration file, nlu_config.yml, with the following content:

language: "en"
pipeline:
- name: "SpacyNLP"
- name: "SpacyTokenizer"
- name: "SpacyFeaturizer"
- name: "RegexFeaturizer"
- name: "CRFEntityExtractor"
- name: "EntitySynonymMapper"
- name: "SklearnIntentClassifier"

Create a training data file, nlu_data.md, with some examples of user intents and entities:

## intent:greet
- hi
- hello
- hey

## intent:goodbye
- bye
- goodbye
- see you later

## intent:ask_weather
- what's the weather like in [New York](location)?
- how's the weather in [Los Angeles](location)?
- what is the temperature in [Paris](location)?

Now, train the Rasa NLU model with the provided data:

from rasa_nlu.training_data import load_data
from rasa_nlu.config import RasaNLUModelConfig
from rasa_nlu.model import Trainer
from rasa_nlu import config

training_data = load_data("nlu_data.md")
trainer = Trainer(config.load("nlu_config.yml"))
interpreter = trainer.train(training_data)

# Save the trained model for future use
model_directory = trainer.persist("./models/nlu", fixed_model_name="current")

Finally, update the process_input function to parse user input and identify intents, entities, and other key information:

def process_input(user_input):
    # Use the Rasa NLU interpreter to parse the user input
    parsed_input = interpreter.parse(user_input)

    # Extract intent and entities from the parsed input
    intent = parsed_input["intent"]["name"]
    entities = {entity["entity"]: entity["value"] for entity in parsed_input["entities"]}

    # Process the user input based on the identified intent and entities
    if intent == "greet":
        response = "Hello! How can I help you today?"
    elif intent == "goodbye":
        response = "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
    elif intent == "ask_weather":
        location = entities.get("location", "unknown")
        response = f"I'm not currently able to check the weather, but you asked about {location}."
    else:
        prompt = f"Athena, please help me with the following: {user_input}"
        response = generate_gpt3_response(prompt)

    return response

This updated process_input function now uses Rasa NLU to understand the user's input and generate appropriate responses based on the identified intents and entities. You can expand the functionality by adding more intents and entities to the training data and handling them in the process_input function.

Me> Ok, I've updated and commited the code. However, I can't run it because I need to install some libraries. On Windows this might be difficult, can you help me setup a Docker container to run this in?

Athena> Certainly! You can use Docker to create an isolated environment for running your application. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a Docker container:

Install Docker Desktop for Windows from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop and follow the installation instructions.

Once Docker is installed and running, create a Dockerfile in your project's root directory with the following content:

# Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements.txt file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Set environment variables from .env file (if exists)
COPY .env* /app/

# Install the Spacy language model
RUN python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "main.py"]

Create a requirements.txt file in your project's root directory, listing the required Python packages:

openai
python-dotenv
rasa_nlu[spacy]

In the terminal, navigate to your project's root directory and build the Docker image:

docker build -t athena-ai .

Make sure to include the period (.) at the end of the command, which indicates the build context is the current directory.

After the build process is complete, run the Docker container:

docker run -it --rm --name athena-ai-instance athena-ai

This command creates and runs a new Docker container named athena-ai-instance, based on the athena-ai image. The -it flag allows for an interactive terminal, while the --rm flag ensures the container is removed when you exit.

Now, your application should be running inside the Docker container, with all necessary dependencies installed. You can interact with the application through the terminal, just as you would if it were running directly on your system.

When you're done using the application, simply type 'exit' to stop the container, or press CTRL+C.

Me> I'm still trying to build this but I notice that the env file is copied into the Dockerfile, I'm concerned that when I distribute this package my OpenAI API key will be included in the image.

Athena> You're right to be concerned about that. To avoid including your API key in the Docker image, we can make a small change to the Dockerfile. Instead of copying the .env file into the image, we can use Docker's --env-file flag to pass the environment variables to the container when running it.

Remove the following line from your Dockerfile:

# Remove this line
COPY .env* /app/

Save the Dockerfile and rebuild the Docker image:

docker build -t athena-ai .

When running the Docker container, use the --env-file flag to pass the environment variables from your .env file:

docker run -it --rm --name athena-ai-instance --env-file .env athena-ai

By following these steps, your API key and other environment variables will be passed to the container at runtime, without being included in the Docker image. This ensures that your sensitive information remains secure when distributing the package.

Me> Ok, I think we should update your README with setups on how to get setup and running, can you help me with that?

Athena> Of course! Here's a suggested outline for the README.md file that includes instructions on setting up and running Athena using both local Python installation and Docker:

This updated README.md includes instructions for pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub and running it. Users can now easily get Athena up and running using the pre-built Docker image.

Me> Let's move on to adding new features and capabilities and create a plugin system to extend Athena's functionality with modules for specific tasks or domains, such as finance, health, or programming.

Athena> 

Creating a plugin system for Athena will allow you to modularly add new features and capabilities, making it easy to extend the AI's functionality for specific tasks or domains. Here's a high-level plan for implementing a plugin system:

Define a base plugin class that all plugins will inherit from.
Implement a plugin manager to discover, load, and manage plugins.
Update the process_input function to utilize the plugin system.
Create example plugins for specific tasks or domains.
Step 1: Define a base plugin class
Create a new file called plugin_base.py:

class PluginBase:
    def __init__(self, name, description):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description

    def can_process(self, input_text):
        raise NotImplementedError("The 'can_process' method must be implemented in derived classes.")

    def process(self, input_text):
        raise NotImplementedError("The 'process' method must be implemented in derived classes.")

This base class defines the structure that all plugins must follow. Each plugin should implement the can_process method to determine whether it can handle a given input, and the process method to handle the input and generate a response.

Step 2: Implement a plugin manager
Create a new file called plugin_manager.py:

import os
import importlib
import pkgutil

class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self, plugin_base_class, plugin_package):
        self.plugin_base_class = plugin_base_class
        self.plugin_package = plugin_package
        self.plugins = []

    def discover_plugins(self):
        plugins_path = os.path.dirname(self.plugin_package.__file__)
        for (_, module_name, _) in pkgutil.iter_modules([plugins_path]):
            module = importlib.import_module(f"{self.plugin_package.__name__}.{module_name}")
            for plugin_class in module.__dict__.values():
                if (isinstance(plugin_class, type) and
                        issubclass(plugin_class, self.plugin_base_class) and
                        plugin_class != self.plugin_base_class):
                    self.plugins.append(plugin_class())

    def process_input(self, input_text):
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            if plugin.can_process(input_text):
                return plugin.process(input_text)
        return None

The PluginManager class discovers and loads plugins based on the specified base class and package. The discover_plugins method finds and imports all plugin modules in the given package, and the process_input method iterates through the loaded plugins to find one that can handle the input.

Step 3: Update the process_input function
In main.py, update the process_input function to use the PluginManager:

from plugin_manager import PluginManager
from plugin_base import PluginBase
import plugins  # assuming plugins will be stored in a "plugins" directory/package

def process_input(input_text):
    plugin_manager = PluginManager(PluginBase, plugins)
    plugin_manager.discover_plugins()

    response = plugin_manager.process_input(input_text)
    if response is None:
        response = generate_response(input_text)
    return response

The updated process_input function creates a PluginManager instance, discovers the plugins, and processes the input using the plugins. If no plugin can handle the input, it falls back to the default generate_response method.

Step 4: Create example plugins
To create plugins, first create a new directory called plugins in your project. This is where you'll store all plugin files. For each plugin, create a new Python file in the plugins directory that defines a class that inherits from PluginBase and implements the can_process and

Me> continue where you left off at

Athena> process methods. Here's an example plugin for handling simple arithmetic operations:

In the plugins directory, create a new file called arithmetic_plugin.py:

import re
from plugin_base import PluginBase

class ArithmeticPlugin(PluginBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Arithmetic", "Performs basic arithmetic operations.")

    def can_process(self, input_text):
        return re.search(r'\b(?:add|subtract|multiply|divide)\b', input_text) is not None

    def process(self, input_text):
        input_text = input_text.lower()
        numbers = [int(num) for num in re.findall(r'\d+', input_text)]
        if "add" in input_text:
            result = sum(numbers)
            operation = "addition"
        elif "subtract" in input_text:
            result = numbers[0] - numbers[1]
            operation = "subtraction"
        elif "multiply" in input_text:
            result = numbers[0] * numbers[1]
            operation = "multiplication"
        elif "divide" in input_text:
            result = numbers[0] / numbers[1]
            operation = "division"
        else:
            return "I'm not sure what operation to perform."
        
        return f"The result of the {operation} is {result}."

This example plugin checks if the input contains arithmetic operation keywords (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and processes the input accordingly. It extracts numbers from the input and performs the specified operation.

Update the process_input function in main.py to import the plugins package:

from plugin_manager import PluginManager
from plugin_base import PluginBase
import plugins  # assuming plugins will be stored in a "plugins" directory/package

def process_input(input_text):
    plugin_manager = PluginManager(PluginBase, plugins)
    plugin_manager.discover_plugins()

    response = plugin_manager.process_input(input_text)
    if response is None:
        response = generate_response(input_text)
    return response

Now, when you run Athena, it will automatically discover and use the available plugins to process user input. You can easily extend Athena's functionality by adding more plugins for different tasks or domains, such as finance, health, or programming, following the same structure as the example plugin.

Me> Earlier we changed process_input, integrate those changes with the version we updated here:

def process_input(user_input):
    # Use the Rasa NLU interpreter to parse the user input
    parsed_input = interpreter.parse(user_input)

    # Extract intent and entities from the parsed input
    intent = parsed_input["intent"]["name"]
    entities = {entity["entity"]: entity["value"] for entity in parsed_input["entities"]}

    # Process the user input based on the identified intent and entities
    if intent == "greet":
        response = "Hello! How can I help you today?"
    elif intent == "goodbye":
        response = "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
    elif intent == "ask_weather":
        location = entities.get("location", "unknown")
        response = f"I'm not currently able to check the weather, but you asked about {location}."
    else:
        prompt = f"Athena, please help me with the following: {user_input}"
        response = generate_gpt3_response(prompt)

    return response

Athena> To integrate the previous changes made to the process_input function with the plugin system, you can update the process method in the example plugin to incorporate the intent and entity extraction using Rasa NLU. Here's the updated code for process_input in main.py:

from plugin_manager import PluginManager
from plugin_base import PluginBase
import plugins  # assuming plugins will be stored in a "plugins" directory/package

def process_input(user_input):
    # Use the Rasa NLU interpreter to parse the user input
    parsed_input = interpreter.parse(user_input)

    # Extract intent and entities from the parsed input
    intent = parsed_input["intent"]["name"]
    entities = {entity["entity"]: entity["value"] for entity in parsed_input["entities"]}

    # Create a PluginManager instance, discover the plugins, and process the input using the plugins
    plugin_manager = PluginManager(PluginBase, plugins)
    plugin_manager.discover_plugins()

    response = plugin_manager.process_input(user_input)
    if response is None:
        if intent == "greet":
            response = "Hello! How can I help you today?"
        elif intent == "goodbye":
            response = "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
        elif intent == "ask_weather":
            location = entities.get("location", "unknown")
            response = f"I'm not currently able to check the weather, but you asked about {location}."
        else:
            prompt = f"Athena, please help me with the following: {user_input}"
            response = generate_gpt3_response(prompt)

    return response

Now, the process_input function first attempts to process the user input using the available plugins. If no plugin can handle the input, it falls back to processing the input based on the intent and entities extracted using Rasa NLU.

Note that this integration assumes your plugins do not rely on Rasa NLU for intent and entity extraction. If you want your plugins to utilize Rasa NLU, you should pass the parsed_input (which includes the intent and entities) to the can_process and process methods in the plugin system and update the plugin classes accordingly.

Me> Let's continue by adding new features and capabilities an implementation of a user authentication and personalization system to provide tailored experiences for individual users.

Athena> To implement a user authentication and personalization system, you can follow these steps:

Create a user management system to store user data.
Implement a user authentication mechanism.
Implement a personalization system that leverages user data to provide tailored experiences.
Update the process_input function to support user authentication and personalization.
Step 1: Create a user management system
Create a simple user management system to store user data. For simplicity, we'll use a Python dictionary to store user data, but in a real-world scenario, you would want to use a database.

class UserManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}

    def register_user(self, username, password):
        if username in self.users:
            return False
        self.users[username] = {
            "password": password,
            "preferences": {}
        }
        return True

    def authenticate_user(self, username, password):
        return username in self.users and self.users[username]["password"] == password

    def set_user_preference(self, username, key, value):
        if username in self.users:
            self.users[username]["preferences"][key] = value
            return True
        return False

    def get_user_preference(self, username, key):
        if username in self.users and key in self.users[username]["preferences"]:
            return self.users[username]["preferences"][key]
        return None

Step 2: Implement user authentication
Update the process_input function to support user authentication by adding a new plugin to handle user registration and authentication:

In the plugins directory, create a new file called authentication_plugin.py:

from plugin_base import PluginBase

class AuthenticationPlugin(PluginBase):
    def __init__(self, user_manager):
        super().__init__("Authentication", "Handles user authentication and registration.")
        self.user_manager = user_manager

    def can_process(self, input_text):
        return any(keyword in input_text.lower() for keyword in ["register", "authenticate", "login", "sign up"])

    def process(self, input_text):
        input_text = input_text.lower().strip()
        words = input_text.split()
        if len(words) != 3:
            return "Please provide your username and password."

        command, username, password = words
        if command in ["register", "sign up"]:
            if self.user_manager.register_user(username, password):
                return f"User {username} registered successfully."
            else:
                return f"User {username} already exists."
        elif command in ["authenticate", "login"]:
            if self.user_manager.authenticate_user(username, password):
                return f"User {username} authenticated successfully."
            else:
                return "Invalid username or password."
        else:
            return "Invalid command. Please use 'register' or 'authenticate'."

Update the process_input function in main.py to instantiate the AuthenticationPlugin and pass it to the PluginManager:

from plugin_manager import PluginManager
from plugin_base import PluginBase
import plugins  # assuming plugins will be stored in a "plugins" directory/package
from authentication_plugin import AuthenticationPlugin

user_manager = UserManager()
auth_plugin = AuthenticationPlugin(user_manager)

def process_input(user_input):
    # ... (Rasa NLU and plugin manager code) ...

    plugin_manager = PluginManager(PluginBase, plugins, extra_plugins=[auth_plugin])
    plugin_manager.discover_plugins()

   # ... (remaining code) ...

Update the PluginManager class to accept extra_plugins as a parameter:

class PluginManager:
    def __init__(

Me> continue where you left off at

Athena> I apologize for the interruption. Continuing from where we left off:

class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self, base_class, package, extra_plugins=None):
        self.base_class = base_class
        self.package = package
        self.plugins = []

        if extra_plugins is not None:
            self.plugins.extend(extra_plugins)

    # ... (remaining methods) ...

Step 3: Implement personalization
Update the process_input function to support personalization. For simplicity, we'll assume that the user is already authenticated and their username is available. In a real-world scenario, you would need to manage user sessions and obtain the username from the session.

def process_input(user_input, username=None):
    # ... (Rasa NLU and plugin manager code) ...

    if username is not None:
        personalization_data = user_manager.get_user_preference(username, "personalization_data")
        if personalization_data is not None:
            # Apply personalization logic using personalization_data
            pass

    # ... (remaining code) ...

Step 4: Update main loop
Finally, update the main loop in main.py to include the username in the process_input function call:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            break

        username = "example_username"  # Replace this with a real username
        response = process_input(user_input, username)
        print(f"Athena: {response}")

With these changes, Athena can now handle user authentication and provide personalized responses based on user preferences. You can further extend this system to store additional user data and use it to customize responses or apply additional personalization logic.

Me> It seems like we should ask the user for their name instead of using a mock value

Athena> You're right. Let's update the main loop in main.py to ask for the user's name before starting the conversation. We will also store the entered name as the username for the personalized experience.

Me> Before continuing I think we should cleanup the structure of the code, what do you think?

Athena> Yes, it's a good idea to organize the code to improve readability, maintainability, and make it easier to add new features in the future. Here's a suggestion for cleaning up the structure:

Create a new directory called athena and move main.py inside it.
Rename main.py to __init__.py. This will make athena a package.
Move the UserManager class into a new file called user_manager.py inside the athena directory.
Move the PluginBase, PluginManager, and all plugin-related code into a new directory called plugins inside the athena directory. You can further organize this by having separate files for each plugin class.
Update the imports in all files to reflect the new structure.
After reorganizing, your directory structure should look like this:


athena/
│   __init__.py
│   user_manager.py
│
└───plugins/
    │   __init__.py
    │   plugin_base.py
    │   plugin_manager.py
    │   authentication_plugin.py
    │   ... (other plugin files)

In the new __init__.py (previously main.py), update the imports:

from .user_manager import UserManager
from .plugins import PluginManager, PluginBase, AuthenticationPlugin

In user_manager.py, make sure to define the UserManager class.

In the plugins directory, create an __init__.py file to make it a package, and update the imports in the plugin files to use relative imports, like:

from .plugin_base import PluginBase

Now, the code should be cleaner and more organized, making it easier to add new features and maintain the codebase.

Me> Shouldn't we move our main function into a __main__ file?

Athena> Yes, that's a great idea! Separating the main function into a __main__.py file is a Python best practice that makes your code more modular and makes it easier to use your package as both a library and a standalone application.

To implement this change, follow these steps:

Create a new file named __main__.py inside the athena directory.
Move the main function (the part of the code that starts the conversation loop) from __init__.py to __main__.py.
In the new __main__.py file, you should have:

from . import process_input, UserManager
from .plugins import AuthenticationPlugin

def main():
    print("Welcome to Athena!")
    username = input("Please enter your name: ")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input(f"{username}: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            break

        response = process_input(user_input, username)
        print(f"Athena: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

After making these changes, you can run your package as a standalone application by executing the following command from the parent directory of the athena package:

python -m athena

This command runs the __main__.py script as the main entry point for the athena package.

Me> I've updated your main function to look like this:

def main():
    print("Welcome to Athena!")
    username = input("Please enter your name: ")

    try:
        while True:
            user_input = input(f"{username}: ")
            if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
                break

            response = process_input(user_input, username)
            print(f"Athena: {response}")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    print("Athena: Goodbye!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Athena> This updated version of the main function improves the user experience by handling the KeyboardInterrupt exception. When the user presses Ctrl+C, the program will now exit gracefully, displaying a goodbye message instead of a traceback error. The updated code is as follows:

def main():
    print("Welcome to Athena!")
    username = input("Please enter your name: ")

    try:
        while True:
            user_input = input(f"{username}: ")
            if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
                break

            response = process_input(user_input, username)
            print(f"Athena: {response}")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    print("Athena: Goodbye!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This is a great improvement to the code, making it more user-friendly and providing a better experience for users when they decide to exit the application.

Me> I think there's too much code in the __init__.py file, what do you think? This is the current contents: import os

    # Extract intent and entities from the parsed input
    intent = parsed_input["intent"]["name"]
    entities = {entity["entity"]: entity["value"] for entity in parsed_input["entities"]}

    # Create a PluginManager instance, discover the plugins, and process the input using the plugins

    plugin_manager.discover_plugins()

    if username is not None:

        else:
            prompt = f"Athena, please help me with the following: {user_input}"
            response = generate_gpt3_response(prompt)

    return response

Athena> You're right. The __init__.py file contains a lot of code and can be further organized by separating concerns into different files.

Here's a suggestion for reorganizing the code:

Create a new file named gpt3_utils.py inside the athena directory and move the generate_gpt3_response function to that file.

Move the Rasa NLU related code (training and interpreter setup) to a new file named nlu_utils.py inside the athena directory.

In the __init__.py file, keep only the import statements, global variables, and the process_input function.

After reorganizing, your __init__.py file should look like this:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from athena.plugins.plugin_manager import PluginManager
from athena.plugins.plugin_base import PluginBase
import plugins  # assuming plugins will be stored in a "plugins" directory/package
from athena.user_manager import UserManager
from athena.plugins.authentication_plugin import AuthenticationPlugin
from .gpt3_utils import generate_gpt3_response
from .nlu_utils import interpreter

load_dotenv()

# Load the API key from the environment variable
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

user_manager = UserManager()
auth_plugin = AuthenticationPlugin(user_manager)

def process_input(user_input, username=None):

In gpt3_utils.py:

import openai

def generate_gpt3_response(prompt):

In nlu_utils.py:

from rasa_nlu.training_data import load_data
from rasa_nlu.config import RasaNLUModelConfig
from rasa_nlu.model import Trainer
from rasa_nlu import config
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

training_data = load_data("nlu_data.md")
trainer = Trainer(config.load("nlu_config.yml"))
interpreter = trainer.train(training_data)

# Save the trained model for future use
model_directory = trainer.persist("./models/nlu", fixed_model_name="current")

After these changes, your code is cleaner and more organized, making it easier to add new features and maintain the codebase.

Me> Shouldn't we move the process_input to a new file as well?

Athena> Yes, it's a good idea to move the process_input function to a separate file to keep the __init__.py file cleaner and more focused on importing the necessary components. You can create a new file called input_processor.py inside the athena directory and move the process_input function there.

After doing so, your __init__.py file should look like this:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from athena.user_manager import UserManager
from athena.plugins.authentication_plugin import AuthenticationPlugin
from .input_processor import process_input

load_dotenv()

# Load the API key from the environment variable
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

user_manager = UserManager()
auth_plugin = AuthenticationPlugin(user_manager)

And the new input_processor.py file should contain:

from athena.plugins.plugin_manager import PluginManager
from athena.plugins.plugin_base import PluginBase
import plugins  # assuming plugins will be stored in a "plugins" directory/package
from .gpt3_utils import generate_gpt3_response
from .nlu_utils import interpreter

def process_input(user_input, username=None):
    # (The code remains the same as before)

Now, the __init__.py file is focused on initializing the necessary components, and the process_input function is located in a separate file, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.

Me> (I helped out a little bit here...)
